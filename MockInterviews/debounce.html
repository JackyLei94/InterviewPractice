  *debounce-question*
This question was one of the questions that I got in my first onsite. You don't need any frameworks or libraries for this.

Parts
Create two textareas so that when you type in one the text is mirrored in the other.
Think about if every time you typed in the textarea you sent a request to a server. What would be the issue with this? How could you make it so that the request is only sent if the user has not been typing for a period of time? Hint: it's literally in the title of this repo.
Implement this method from scratch and don't look at the library code.
Make it so that when you type in one textbox it only populates the other textarea if the user hasn't typed for 500 milliseconds.
